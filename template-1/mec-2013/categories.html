  <h3>MEC 2013 Categories</h3>
<p>When we said we wanted to organize the best MEC yet we were not kidding, this year we have expanded the selection of categories and have two brand new categories: Innovative Design and Engineering Communication!</p> 
<h4>Innovative Design</h4>
<p>This highly technical category requires competitors (teams of 4) to present an innovative and commercially viable solution to a problem of their own choosing. Competitors are expected to carry out market research and feasibility studies as well as draft a business proposal for their product, in order to promote their product prototype at a booth for the public and the other attendees at the competition. Teams will be evaluated during a 20 minute presentation followed by a 10 minute question period. Presentations should include the following points: commercialisation, efficacy, technical feasibility, fabrication, economic aspects and applications beyond those of the original model. It is required that teams are prepared prior to the competition day.</p>
<h4>Engineering Communication</h4>
<p>In this event, teams of 2 contestants are challenged to present a clear and concise explanation of a technical product or process in layman’s terms, and present an analysis of its societal and environmental impacts. Presentations are made to a panel of technical and nontechnical judges and are evaluated on the presenter’s public-speaking skills and ability to persuade the audience. The presentations should contain a 500 word description of the subject and be presented in 15 minutes with a 10 minute question period. Teams should submit their topic upon registration. </p>
<h4>Consulting Engineering</h4>
<p>Teams of four participants are given approximately four hours to devise a clever solution to a real-world problem prescribed by a hypothetical client. Each team is expected to assess the economic, social, and environmental aspects and present a persuasive proposal to the hypothetical client. Teams will have 15 minutes to present their results followed by a 10 minute question period.</p>
<h4>Impromptu Debate</h4>
<p>Teams of two participate in a fast-paced, high-energy debate where they are challenged to defend, from a given stance, a topic revealed immediately preceding the event. Competitors are judged on their ability to present convincing, well-structured arguments on a wide pool of engineering relevant topics.</p>
<h4>Junior Team Design</h4>
<p>Exclusive to first and second year students (completed less than 60 credits), this category challenges teams of four to apply basic engineering skills to solve a physical design problem. Each team is given approximately four hours and specific materials to come up with the presentation outlining their solution process, as well as the demonstration of a working prototype to the panel of judges.</p>
<h4>Senior Team Design</h4>
<p>Exclusive to third and fourth year students (completed 60+ credits), this category demands teams of four to design and build a prototype that solves a complex engineering task or problem. Though the general topic is presented to competitors a week in advance, specific objectives and constraints are disclosed the day of the event. With approximately eight hours and limited materials, competitors must present and test their prototype for a panel of judges. This competition often leans towards mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines (although all are encouraged to participate).</p>
<h4>Re-Engineering</h4>
<p>This competition aims to test participants’ ability to improve existing products so that they satisfy new constraints. Teams of two are encouraged to display their imagination, creativity, technical ability, and public-speaking skills. You will have four hours to complete your project and create a presentation of 15-20 minutes.</p>

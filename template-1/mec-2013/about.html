  <h3>What is MEC?</h3>
<p>The McGill Engineering Competition is an event showcasing the most innovative and creative world-class minds across McGill University, gathered to compete against each other in one of seven categories ranging from design challenges and parliamentary debate contests to product development and engineering consulting competitions. The winners are selected to represent the university and advance to the Quebec Engineering Competition where they may later be selected to compete in the Canadian Engineering Competition.</p>
<p>The competition provides a valuable opportunity for industry participation in the training of talented new engineers by supporting their professional development and providing them with tools and experiences that build a framework around their strong theoretical knowledge. This powerful yet intimate experience challenges its participants to expand their frame of reference and to identify solutions to problems experienced by our profession. Additionally, it enables students to explore their professional future and connect with leaders in their industry of preference. </p>

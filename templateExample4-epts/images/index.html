				<p>The Engineering Peer Tutoring Service is a free tutoring service for U0 and U1 engineering students sponsored by the Faculty of Engineering. Tutorial office hours are held on a weekly basis in the McGill Engineering Student Centre on the ground floor of the Frank Dawson Adams Building, Room 6B. 
The tutorial program has been available to engineering students for more than 40 years to ease the transition from high school and CEGEP to university. The first year at university often requires students to make adjustments to their study practices and to develop new study skills. Although most Engineering Faculty courses are conducted by professors and teaching assistants and include tutorials, some students require additional personal attention.</p>
<p>This is where the Peer Tutoring Service can play a key role in assuring student success at McGill. EPTS tutors can answer some of the most challenging questions and help give students what they need to obtain results in their respective field of study. EPTS also offers direct contact with an upper-year student who has already been through the program!</p>
<p>Tutorial office hours for Winter 2013 have begun and run through to the end of the semester. In addition to the tutorial hours, review seminars are held each semester prior to midterm exams.
				</p>
				<h4>Advisory Committee</h4>
				<p>
				Ms. Judy Pharo (Director, Engineering Student Centre), Professor Mohamed Meguid (Associate Dean, Student Affairs) and Professor Siva Nadarajah form the advisory committee. They and the student EPTS manager, Andrea Gideon, form the link between the tutors and the McGill administration and oversee operation of the service. They also work to ensure that EPTS receives continued funding.
